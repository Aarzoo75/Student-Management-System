# Student-Management-System
Student Management System Project In Java – A Student Management System (SMS) is a software program that tracks, maintains, and manages all of the data created by a school, such as a student’s grades, attendance, and interpersonal activity records, among other things.  The Student Management System’s major goal is to keep track of Profiles, Courses, Logins, Exams, and Fees. It keeps track of all information pertaining to Profiles, Students, Fees, and Profiles. Because the project is entirely constructed at the administrative level, only the administrator has access.

# Importance of Student Management System In Java
It simplifies and streamlines all tasks: Keeping track of all the activities completed by each student is never easy or efficient for a teacher. Teachers, on the other hand, may keep track of each student’s work and what has to be done using this online school administration software.
